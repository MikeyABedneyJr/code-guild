- merge all blog js into one file
	- maybe use Require js to demonstrate managed js modules
- link logins to voting maybe?
- password reset through email code
	- django-recaptcha for registration
	- multi factor auth with SMS message (twilio?)
- other feature ideas:
	- post / comment tagging
- animate dashed border on dragenter
- wire up the user edits to db to update image title
and add a caption.
- add search functionality to search comments or blogs
	- maybe a checkbox or something?
- maybe remove gradient and border radius from boot strap buttons?
