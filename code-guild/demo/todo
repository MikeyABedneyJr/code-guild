- merge all blog js into one file
	- maybe use Require js to dmeonstrate managed js modules
- link logins to voting maybe?
- password reset through email code
	- captcha for registration
	- multi factor auth with SMS message (twilio?)
- other feature ideas:
	- post / comment tagging
	- search posts / comments
		- save queries to db for reuse
	- user profiles
		- show posts you've commented / voted on
- drag and drop file uploader
	- show thumbnails
	- allow for delete from server
	- animate dashed border on dragenter

- captions and user created titles for images	
- need to write callback handler for ajax response for drag and drop
[[ base.html ]]
  [[ block trash_home ]]
    [[ block AJAX_response_template ]]

- thumbnails now displaying.  I just need to size them down with css.
  I also need to add functionality to edit captions and title as well
  as delete photos.
