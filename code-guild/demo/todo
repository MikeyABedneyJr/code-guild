- move all app specific script and link tags into a block and plug block into base
- merge all blog js into one file
	- looking at using AMD with Require js to organize my js files
- link logins to voting maybe?
- other feature ideas:
	- post / comment tagging
	- search posts / comments
	- user profiles
- paginate blog posts
	- now I'm using django endless pagination
	- i need the newly paginated blogs to have their event listeners attached
	  without double attaching to nodes that already have the necessary event listeners
