- move all app specific script and link tags into a block and plug block into base
- merge all blog js into one file
- link logins to voting maybe?
- other feature ideas:
	- post / comment tagging
	- search posts / comments
	- user profiles
- paginate blog posts
	- Pages were loading and appending posts correctly to the DOM with their event
	listeners, but I cannot easily use the template engine to further process the 
	returned data.  This means that the body markdown and times would have to be 
	(again) parsed, but this time in JS.  As it stands, I have decided not use AJAX 
	for further development of this feature.
	- I will use regular page loads and stick with Django's built in paginator
